Chris Pratt is being chased by a dinosaur and the only way out is through a maze. The maze has only 1 entrance and 1 exit. The maze consists of N*N cells placed adjacent to each other like a gigantic cube. Every cell, other than the ones at the lower edges, have 2 exits (right-R and down-D). But Chris soon realises that he is not alone in the maze. A few dinosaurs are present in few of the cells. The maze is modelled as a binary square matrix and the cells in which dinosaurs are present are marked with a zero. Help Chris get out of the maze alive by finding out all the possible paths that Chris can take to get out of the maze!

 

Input Description:
An integer N denoting the dimension of the matrix, followed by the elements of the matrix (0 or 1)
