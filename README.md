This repo containes my approach for solving the TCS codevita 2020 Zone - 2,
# (Note: This was created after the contest, and for reference, and sharing my ideas, And these questions are taken from online websites,) 

# The Approaches are all coded in PYTHON 3

#### 3-Palindrome, I have tried my best approach to solve the question only by using recursion, and no loops

#### Elections, I have actually used a straight forward native approach of countaing the neutrals and handling them with loops
