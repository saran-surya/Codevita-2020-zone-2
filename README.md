# Codevita-2020-zone-2 (Round-1)
This repo containes my approach for solving the TCS codevita 2020 Zone - 2 questions,
# Note: This was created after the contest, and for reference, and sharing my ideas, And these questions are taken from online websites

# The Approaches are all coded in PYTHON 3

#### 3-Palindrome, I have tried my best approach to solve the question only by using recursion, and no loops

#### Elections, I have actually used a straight forward native approach of countaing the neutrals and handling them with loops

#### Tennis Court, I have come up with a solution that is accurate to the mark, need some text modifications in the output, and please feel free to raise pull requests for this question,

#### String Merge, I have also followed a Naitive with a dynamic approach, Feel free to raise pull requests for performance issues and edge cases.
 - #### [String Merge](https://github.com/saran-surya/Codevita-2020-zone-2/tree/master/string_merge)

#### Path through Graph, Followed a simple mathematical approach, Feel free to raise pull requests for performance issues and edge cases.
 - #### [Path Through Graph](https://github.com/saran-surya/Codevita-2020-zone-2/tree/master/path_through_graph)

#### Factor of 3, Followed a simple Permutation logic in order to reduce Time.  Feel free to raise pull requests for performance issues and edge cases.
 - #### [Factor of 3](https://github.com/saran-surya/Codevita-2020-zone-2/tree/master/factor_of_3)

#### Even Odd, Followed a simple Permutation logic.  Feel free to raise pull requests for performance issues and edge cases.
 - #### [Even Odd](https://github.com/saran-surya/Codevita-2020-zone-2/tree/master/even_odd)

#### Unlocker, I have followed a simple naive approach, They work good on given testcases and custom edge cases.  Feel free to raise pull requests for performance issues and edge cases.
