# Codevita-2020-zone-2
This repo containes my approach for solving the TCS codevita 2020 Zone - 2,
# (Note: This was created after the contest, and for reference, and sharing my ideas, And these questions are taken from online websites, and not from the codevita Website itself.) 

# The Approaches are all coded in PYTHON 3
