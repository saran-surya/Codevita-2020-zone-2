## Contains solutions to programming questions asked in interviews / coding rounds
### Covers Dynamic programming, Greedy, Recursion.
### The Approaches are all coded in PYTHON 3

1) #### 3-Palindrome, I have tried my best approach to solve the question only by using recursion, and no loops
   - #### [3-Palindrome](https://github.com/saran-surya/Codevita-2020-zone-2/tree/master/3%20Palindrome)

2) #### Elections, I have actually used a straight forward native approach of countaing the neutrals and handling them with loops
   - #### [Election](https://github.com/saran-surya/Codevita-2020-zone-2/tree/master/elections)

3) #### Tennis Court, A longer program as the points logic was to be implemented for all cases of serves and sets.
   - #### [Tennis Court](https://github.com/saran-surya/Codevita-2020-zone-2/tree/master/tennis_court)

4) #### String Merge, I have also followed a Naitive with a dynamic approach.
   - #### [String Merge](https://github.com/saran-surya/Codevita-2020-zone-2/tree/master/string_merge)

5) #### Path through Graph, Followed a simple mathematical approach.
   - #### [Path Through Graph](https://github.com/saran-surya/Codevita-2020-zone-2/tree/master/path_through_graph)

6) #### Factor of 3, Followed a simple Permutation logic in order to reduce Time.
   - #### [Factor of 3](https://github.com/saran-surya/Codevita-2020-zone-2/tree/master/factor_of_3)

7) #### Even Odd, Followed a simple Permutation logic.
   - #### [Even Odd](https://github.com/saran-surya/Codevita-2020-zone-2/tree/master/even_odd)

8) #### Unlocker, I have followed a simple naive approach, They work good on given testcases and custom edge cases.  
   - #### [Unlocker](https://github.com/saran-surya/Codevita-2020-zone-2/tree/master/unlocker)

9) #### T-Rex and Theme park question, I have completely used recursion for the path finding algorithm, and it is effective for all edge cases.
   - #### [T-Rex in Theme Park](https://github.com/saran-surya/Codevita-2020-zone-2/tree/master/theme_park)

10) #### Chris Patt dinosaur (path in a matrix), I have completely used recursion for the path finding algorithm, and it is effective for all edge cases.
